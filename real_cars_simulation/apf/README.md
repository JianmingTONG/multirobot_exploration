# File Description
1. apf_node.cpp: Advanced APF designed and optimized for generating the goal in multi-frontier exploration task. CONS: target cluster, wave-front distance, river-flow local minimum avoidance, physical electrical field.
2. traditional_apf_node.cpp: Traditional APF extended to multiple targets application without target cluster. And wave-front is generated from the robot location.
3. traditional_apf_node_kobuki.cpp:  Traditional APF used in kobuki robots.
